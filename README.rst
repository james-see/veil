what
----

Veil is a project that attempts to build an uncollectable webpage. The goals of Veil are:

1. block curl
2. block wget
3. block phantomjs
4. block google & other traditional search engine crawlers
5. block a python script that ignores robots.txt & spoofs user behavior and user agents
6. block screenshot captures
7. block click & drag capturing
8. block mobile captures

why
---

Building custom web scraping robots is one thing. But building sites that can defend themselves from said robots is another.

build plan
----------

Simply veil1.html, veil2.html etc. will exist in examples folder as the project progresses with more features and more capabilities. This iterative approach to tackling this issues is best to track progress and to build from previous versions.

issues
------

At the end of the day, if you want to collect a VEIL-enabled site, you can point a camera at your screen and capture it that way. If Veil succeeds in forcing the operator to do that as their only means, then this project will be considered a success.
